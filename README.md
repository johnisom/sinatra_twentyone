# Twenty One #

[Twenty One/Blackjack][blackjack-wiki] powered by Ruby and the
[Sinatra][sinatra-site] framework. You play as the participant and the
computer plays as the dealer. It is hosted live on Heroku at [this
link][herokuapp].

I built this from scratch, with the exception of the Sinatra framework. Keep
in mind that this app is entirely server-based, so there is no JavaScript or
event handling.
